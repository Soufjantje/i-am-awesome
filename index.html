    <h1>The story of Franklin the hustler</h1>
    <p>Franklin,a 24-year-old from Wingene, grew up in the slums of New York. His father disappeared when he was young, and his family struggled with poverty. With no other options, he turned to his uncle Jerome, who showed him a way to make money, not the right way, but it worked. Soon, Franklin found himself in the illegal business, learning that sometimes, to survive, you have to break the rules.</p>

    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <p> In this game, Franklin has to pick up bags from his uncle and deliver them to his friends. As the game progresses, the deliveries get harder because the levels become more challenging. The further you get, the tougher the tasks become. Along the way, you can earn points, which you can use to upgrade your character and customize it to your liking. You can also gain more power by collecting ribbons. The game ends when Franklin becomes the boss of the work he used to do, instead of just being his uncles helper.</p>
